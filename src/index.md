**Featured Site: [Lene Saile](https://www.lenesaile.com/en/)**
 I discovered her site through [built at lightspeed](https://www.builtatlightspeed.com/category/eleventy?themes%5Bpage%5D=2) because I love looking at what people are doing with 11ty. Her site brings color in a gray world. Her blogs give useful insights into front end developement (I enjoyed her post about [CSS grid inheritance](https://www.lenesaile.com/en/blog/inheriting-grid-dimensions-from-siblings-with-subgrid/))

 **Current Thought: Aging on the Web**
Naz Hamid wrote about the [awkwardness of middle age](https://nazhamid.com/journal/midlife-malaise-part-ii/) and so has [Rachel Kown](https://kwon.nyc/notes/my-lil-midlife-crisis). We on the internet are getting old. Freshman, naive, 20 year old me believed everyone was younger, smarter, and funnier than me. *look at those 14 year olds creating their 7 billion dollar healthcare as a service software while being stand up comedians*. Many bloggers then and now are not that young. You can find 80 year olds talking about the jamstack. That's pretty awesome.
