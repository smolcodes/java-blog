I have only begun this book and so far I love it! Right now I'm on the part where the son transtions from the dreamworld to maybe the real world.

## Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrel
<b>Susanna Clarke</b>

I started this a while ago because I love *Piranesi* so much. The writing does not disspaoint and there truly is a plethora of Jonathan's.
