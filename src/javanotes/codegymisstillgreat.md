I’ve never wrote a negative post about Codegym but there’s a place and time for everything (this site is still the best there is imho). The instructions need clarification. The order that the input is accepted in is important. It must be number and then name (although it’s not printed like that). And while you are accepting an input by the user YOU aren’t actually inputting anything. Basically you don’t have to print statements like&nbsp;“put in a number”.
