## **_For a Student Who Used AI to Write a Paper_**

**Now I let it fall back  
in the grasses.  
I hear you. I know  
this life is hard now.  
I know your days are precious  
on this earth.  
But what are you trying  
to be free of?  
The living? The miraculous  
task of it?  
Love is for the ones who love the work.**
