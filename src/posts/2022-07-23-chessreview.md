Here, I review four chess sites:

* chess.com
* chesstempo
* lichess
* kasparov chess

I'll give my thoughts on three areas:

* play
* puzzles
* lessons
* appearance 

Note: I am using the free version of these sites

## Chess.com

### play
*rapid rating: 1142*

This is by far the best site to play chess at almost any time speed and whenever it strikes your fancy. The caveat is you can't type in your moves (you can if you use a non chess.com affiliated extension). There is essentially no wait time for games and I found the pairings to be reasonable. You play within +/-100 of your elo range.

### puzzles
*puzzle rating: 1808*

I'm not sure if there's a relationship between puzzle rating and game rating besides a casual one. The puzzles are a fun way to pass time on the bus but I find the rating assigned to them to be...odd. I've solved 1800 rating puzzles that felt like 1000 and have also done the reverse (1000 rated puzzles that felt like 1800). Perhaps the best part about chess.com puzzles is that on the free plan you are limited to 5 puzzles per a day.

I haven't noticed these puzzles improving my game. Maybe such a thing is harder to measure.

I will note a useful feature, when completing a game, in the game review, chess.com will give you suggested puzzles in tactic areas that caused you pain. I found this extremely useful when I purchased premium (for two months). Yes, doing random puzzles is great but I found targeting weak areas to also be very useful. 

### lessons

This is another area where chess.com really shines. I learned how to play chess in elementary school but didn't realize how inadequate my basic knowledge was until I used this site's trial pro subscription. Some exaples: en passent, casteling and how the knights moved. The videos are easy to grasp and the puzzles at the end of each lesson makes what you've learned stick. These lessons took me from 500 elo to 700 in a matter of minutes.

### appearance

The design of the site is consistent although I think very cluttered. I lament the inability to type in moves (I think typing it in trains you to think about the game less visually and more conceptually but hey this could be BS thinking. In any case it is a good way to practice speed typing). You're given a lot of freedom in terms of making your profile (including the board) your own although not as much freedom as lichess.

## Chesstempo

### play

The play experience is bad, which is why I don't have a rating. I have, to no avail, tried to play games. I wonder for sites like this and Kasparov chess, if this is a chicken and egg problem. No players so no one plays.

### puzzles
*puzzle rating: 1164*

The puzzles here are ðŸ”¥. I appreciate the level of difficulty and most importantly the way they rate you. I find my puzzle rating aligns with my actual skill level. I solve puzzles on standard. My mind feels rewarded when I solve the puzzles the way I'm supposed to: methodically using CCT (checks, captures, threats), contemplating candidate moves and how my opponents will react. The best part? You're not timed! *Thinking*, not hastly coming up with a solution, is paramount. The puzzle will also tell you alterntive solutions if possible. There's a nifty chat section where you can read other users' thought proccess. 

### lessons

I have briefly tried their live books and was not really a fan. The interface is a bit clunky to me and I'm going to chalk it up to my eyesight. I don't think Chesstempo is the most accessible of sites for the visually impaired. I use the site strictly for puzzles. 

### appearance 

It is overwhelming but the puzzles themselves are ok. I prefer Chesstempo on mobile as it is much clearer and I can press my face close to the screen to see the chess pieces.

## Lichess

{% myImage "https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c0e7469-3cbf-4a5d-b57e-774e9fa0179d_1882x988.png", "a chess puzzle on the lichess website" %}

### play
*Rapid rating: 1421 (provisional)*

Lichess, like Chess.com, has many users therefore playing games online isn't a problem with the exception of anything 30 minutes and greater. A wonderful plus is the ability to **type in moves**. This feature is a godsend for my wrists (I don't like using a mouse). The play interface is less cluttered than chess.com's. And the sound effects of the pieces on the move are very satisfying.

### puzzles
*puzzle rating: 1614*

The puzzle rating on lichess (imho) are less inflated then chess.com's and the quality of the puzzles feels the same as chess.com's BUT reviewing them is better. The benifit of Lichess is the puzzles are free and you can solve them by category. Or if you choose random, Lichess after several puzzles will tell you what your pain points are.

### lessons

The lessons on Lichess aren't as good as Chess.com's (they show some concept, you copy the concept but they don't explain the concept). However they are free. Ok, this isn't a fair assessment. The lessons are great if you want to dive straight into the action and ignore video frills that plague Chess.com.

Lichess has a practice section which is amazing! Their endgame puzzles are what helped me beat 1200 rated players when I was an 800 rated player.

### appearance 

Although the front page is cluttered, it is less stressful than chess.com. I like the gray and green motifs as well as the plethora of light shadows (good 'ol post 2010 design trends are well and alive here). Lichess has zen mode and their accessiblity features? ðŸ§¡ðŸ§¡ðŸ§¡. I mean, it's not great, there's still much to complain about BUT the fact they put *effort*?? We stan those who do more than give accessibility lip service. 

## Kasparov Chess

{% myImage "https://www.thechessdrum.net/newsbriefs/2021/NB_photos/KasparovChessHome.png", "homepage for kasparov chess" %}

### play

Playing a game on this here site is even more difficult than chesstempo. Let me save you time: don't even try.

### puzzles
*puzzle rating: 1424*

I'm not sure I agree with Gary Chess' rating assessment. I am part of a chess club and most of the players are well over 1400 but that's considered club level. The puzzles are better than chess.com and lichess becasue they actually go further than just 1 move (one puzzle had I think, 4 moves). The pieces themselves could be more differentiatable. <mark>Here's an egregious problem: you *can't* view a chess puzzle history</mark>. Also troubling, they don't tell you the genre of the puzzle.

### lessons

The lessons are professional looking. They look like slick Netfliks documentaries but I don't think I learned anything. I wish they had related puzzles after each lesson so I can put what I've learned into action.

### appearance 

This website is *so* nice but damn is it janky. Certain links are default blue (maybe the designers just noped 99% of the way through?) and some assets just don't load. 

## Conclusion

I prefer Lichess and Chess.com for playing chess and chesstempo for puzzles. I want Kasparov Chess to get better but I don't think it will.
