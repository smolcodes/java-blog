## Covid 19

The year is 2022. Britian sped through 3 prime ministers, Biden is President and Anthony Fauci is no longer constantly on the news. What's his take, right now, on COVID 19?

My area has moved past it and so has everyone I know. I don't really wear a mask anymore. I do when at the grocery store and almost always on the bus. I still get the boosters when it's time. This year I got both the booster and flu shot at the same time. Those two shots roughed me up a bit. 

Ok, continuing with events. Russia is trying to take Ukraine. This war is going on much longer than either side anticipated. Some believe the world should appease Putin. Let him have that country, if we don't he may use the nukes. Others say nay, being independent is important. Before this war though, most people couldn't even find it on a map. I am convinced most Americans still can't correctly locate it. Bolsanaro no longer rules Brazil. El Salvador is betting on bitcoin being successful. And for a while, gas was expensive. Now it's cheap. The news keeps saying a recession is coming. When I look back on this post, in 2030 maybe 2040, I hope to know definitevely if we really were in a recession or not. The news says the US has a chance of having a civil war. It also says the world has a chance of having a world war. The news just really wants a war. And some times I think there are people around me who'd like one also. Xi Jinping is still the ruler of China to no one's surprise. Global warming still exists and we are still not doing much about it. It's been two years since the BLM protests. Everything is still the same. Maybe years from now, historians will say the protests did in fact make a difference. Roe vs Wade got overturned. This is important because by U.S. standards, the Supreme Court is both as diverse as it's ever been *and* conservative. Future humanities PHD students have much to analyze. 

My life is essentially back to normal. I am reading. I am working and I am still not going to the gym. I might join a coffee subscription. I am still wishing for a decent third party contender in any U.S. election.

Man,  the ability to preserve people is truly amazing.

### Watching

* [The House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_(2022_film)) A stop motion film told in three parts. The three stories are tied together by the creation of the house in part 1. Next we follow a rat who remodels the house and the final act invovles a cat who must prepare hersefl to possibley part with the house. It's a really good movie.
* [Fawlty Towers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fawlty_Towers) Some episodes are solid. The ones where all the characters are involved are great. It is very British. Although, it is a bit  difficult to watch because it's on youtube. It's hard to find all episodes in one place.
