This is my take on [ginger scallion noodles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVAQm0u55Z8&ab_channel=Honeysuckle). My recipe takes a tad longer BUT works as a complete meal.

Assuming you use 1lb dried linguini, this recipe serves 8 people.

## Ingrediants

The Noodle

* 1lb of noodles. Whatever you have on hand is good. I suggest a thick kind of noodle like tagliatelle. If you're gluten free you can try [coliflower linguini](https://www.walmart.com/ip/CAULIPOWER-Cauliflower-Linguine-Pasta-8-8-oz-Frozen/961540114?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=0&wl13=2152&adid=22222222277961540114_117755028669_12420145346&wmlspartner=wmtlabs&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=501107745824&wl4=pla-294505072980&wl5=9004731&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=8175035&wl11=local&wl12=961540114&wl13=2152&veh=sem_LIA&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtamlBhD3ARIsAARoaEz5jlpaorW4zyxHrScLL5kVHzkUVL1o4QngTx04JgvbTj9UvKzkwpAaAiD7EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)

The Sauce

* 2tbs soy sauce (for a gluten free option consider [tamari](https://san-j.com/blog/is-soy-sauce-gluten-free/#:~:text=Despite%20its%20name%2C%20soy%20sauce,on%20a%20gluten%2Dfree%20diet.))
* 2tbs white vinegar 
* 2 cups of vegetable oil (or whatever neutral kind of oil you have on hand)
* 2tbs of salt (this might seem a bit much once everything is cooked you won't notice it)
* 2 cloves of garlic
* 2 cups of scallions (green onions)
* 1 cup of freshly grated ginger

The Vegetables

All of this is optional but I think it just makes the food taste better, feel more healthy

* 2 heads of broccoli 
* 3 thinly sliced cucumbers (for super good flavor, soak them in a mixture of soy sauce, peanut/sesame oil, salt and a pinch of sugar for a few minutes)
* a head of bok choy

The Toppings

* 6 eggs (for vegans, vegan eggs will do just fine, or even shredded tofu.)
* Sesame seeds
* 2 cups of cilantro
* 2 cups of scallions
* 2 cups of chopped peanuts

## Steps

### The Sauce

1. In a bowl, grate the ginger, finely chop the garlic and cut the scallions about an inch long. 
2. In the same bowl, put in the salt, vinegar and soy sauce. 
2. Heat up the oil. Wait for it to come close to boiling. Pour the oily carefully into the metal bowl.
4. Let the sauce sit for 15 minutes. The longer, the better.

### The Vegetables

1. Cut the broccoli and bok choy. I don't know how to cook so I cut them in the way an idiot would. 
2. Toss them in a pot of boiling water. Start with the broccoli and then add the bok choy. Take out of the pot when they're at your preferred consistency. I like to add ginger and a bit of salt to the water to flavor the vegetables. Save the water! Put the vegetables to the side.

### The noodles

1. Cook the noodles in the water you used for your vegetables. Take out when the noodles are at your desirable consistency.

### Putting them all together

1. In a large pan, mix together the sauce and noodles

### The Toppings

1. Make 3 [tomagoyaki](https://www.japancentre.com/en/recipe/20-tamagoyaki-japanese-omelette) and then thinly slice them.
2. Chop up the peanuts, scallions and cilantro and place in small bowls.

### The Conclusion

Done! Plate your food with all the good toppings and enjoy.

These noodles pack so much flavor for a dish that's easy to make. Warning: they are very oily.
