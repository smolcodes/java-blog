This post is mainly for me, a person with low vision. I mean the whole blog is really self serving. I don't have much faith in my memory and so want to create a way to remember JAWS easily so in the future I can re-pick it up. So to the fully blind, this post may be *too* focused on aiding those with vision and to those with good vision, you may find the pedagogical oppinions too strong. I *do* think the most important command for a sighted person to learn immediately is screen shade and if you are sighted and serious about wanting to learn JAWS you should use it. 

:::

Here are some basic beginning Jaws commands to get started with. I think probably the most important after screen shade is <kbd>ctrl</kbd>. It pauses JAWS' speech. **Note** JAWS in JAWS commands means the JAWS key. If you are in laptop mode this will be the <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd>. On desktop this will be <kbd>Insert</kbd>.

### Just Getting Started

| JAWS Command      | Keystroke  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Screen Shade | JAWS + Spacebar, F11
| Temporarily Increase/Decrease Speech | Ctrl + Alt + PgUp/PgDown      |
| Permanently Increase/Decrease Speech | Windows + Ctrl + Alt + PgUp/PgDown |
| Time | JAWS + F12
| Date | JAWS + F12 twice
| Where am I? | JAWS + T
| Where am I Focused? | JAWS + Tab
| Pull Up the Jaws Menu | JAWS + J
| Close JAWS | JAWS plus F4
| JAWS Serial Number (must be in JAWS menu) | JAWS PgDn

### JAWS help

These are perhaps the most important commands after the aforementioned ones. To the budding JAWS learner (especially sighted learners), the best advice I can give is to commit all the commands on this page to memory and then start using JAWS immediately-if finances allow-not in 40 minute trial mode.

| JAWS Command      | Keystroke  |

| Keyboard Help | JAWS + 1
| Context Sesnsitive Help | JAWS + F1
| Applications Help | JAWS 2x\[F1\]
