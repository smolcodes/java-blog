I'm introducing a bit of an online CMS into my life. I've been enjoying [Zinzy's notes](https://www.zinzy.website/notes/) and [Barry's](https://barryfrost.com/notes) as well. I've been meaning to find a faster way to share links and jot down my thoughts like them. In that spirit, I'm using [PagesCMS](https://pagescms.org) to mobily add streams of thoughts. You can read them [here](/stream).
