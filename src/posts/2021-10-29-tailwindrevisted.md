I liked how organzied my previous site was but I also hated how clean it looked. It had no personality. I mean I don't know if it has any now. I literally slapped a cat in it and voila! *Personality*. It is structurally exactly the same. The only thing I changed was the look. 

It is wholy possible I am falling out of Tailwind because I'm using it improperly but I think this will be this site's last iteration to use this thing. My professional site is all CSS and it's so easy to wholesale change the look by noodling with one file. My design is spread across billions of different files on this here personal site because of Tailwind's class system (that yes, still feels like inline CSS. I'm sorry. But...that's just how I feel).

There's also a lot of weird edge cases. I am not a professional web designer. I'm an armchair one at best. Tailwind forces you to use actual inline css if you want to add a background image that isn't a gradient (images in general). It's possible you could slap the images in pcss or the tailwind config js file but [that's a lot of work](https://css-tricks.com/images-in-postcss/). Also Tailwind's accordion behaves strangely on Mobile. Now that I think about it, the entire site behaves awkwardly on mobile. I'm always two seconds away from simply adding a plain CSS file along with the standard Tailwind file. Below break I've included some links to articles by knowledgeable people on both the pros and cons of TailwindCSS. 

Now let me point out a few things I love about Tailwind. It is *fast*. You can prototype at the speed of thought. And it is fairely easy to make a site responisve. Ok that's it.

The final verdict is I think TailWindCSS is...not for me. But in general I gripe with all front end frameworks. I find all of them too opinionated. 

I spent a good portion of the day drinking warm water, listening to folk music and remaking this quiet corner of the web so...whatever I guess? It was a nice much needed diversion from Chess.

### Reading

This is a good time to point out that I'm not going to update these posts to reflect which books I've finished. My start to complete ratio is pretty aweful. I don't differentiate between books for school and books for fun. And I only put books I've to some degree enjoyed on here (same for music etc). Why aren't these their own posts? Why tack them at the end of non related stuff? Because I can.
