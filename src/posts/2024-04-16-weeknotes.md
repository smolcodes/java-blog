## Beauty of Blogs

Growing this [links](/links) part of my site has been so fun! I love collecting interesting blogs and then adding them to my little links collection. 

I can't stop listening to this song:

Now I feel odd about it because I learned about this by getting an ad on Instagram. A problem with abstaining from the radio and ads in general is that while I'm overall much happier, I do miss discovering new music. This is part of the reason I enjoy reading blog posts. I've been introduced to Mitsky and Loona because of [Anh](https://anhvn.com/posts/2024/weeknotes-11/) [Faiz](https://fukuo.site/).

Recently I've been obsessed with reading everything by:

[Cynosura](https://web.archive.org/web/20110928073555/http://weblog.cynosura.eu/default.aspx): They've created themes for code editors and maps. They have a post on web2.0 and it's very interesting to read about the present from the perspective of the past. Sadly, I don't think they're on the internet anymore

[Zinzy](https://www.zinzy.website/): They write about all facets of their life, from work to religion to *life*. They are very candid in a way I wish I could be. I don't know, I can't bring myself to openly talk about my experiences irl on the web. I wish I could. Anyway, read their blog, it's really good! Very thought provoking and eye opening.

## Tending to this site

I am in the process of looking for a good markdown CMS, so if you find one, please let me know. I am trying to find a way to easily generate dates for my posts because right now I manually type them in and it's not great. 

I am, once again, tired of the way this blog looks. [Jason Santa Maria](https://v5.jasonsantamaria.com/) and [Arielle](https://arie.ls/) have great text heavy sites. 

Maybe I will leave everything as it is. I don't know. There are people who's blogs have remained unchained since they've started their site. That seems nice. Sometimes I go on this site and enjoy its current iteration.

I spent the last couple of days making a lot of tweeks to the links part of this site and am thinking about adding a navigation section at the footer of the site (kind of like [Hans Gerwitz](https://hans.gerwitz.com/) or [Luke Mitchell](https://www.interroban.gg/)).

I want to create a coffee section for this blog. Over the past two years, I've gone to some amazing coffee shops and want to document them so I will remember them. I just really don't want to deal with photo management. 
[Average Joe Coffeehouse Review](https://averagejoe.reviews/) and [Drift Magazine](https://www.driftmag.com/) are two sites I've been going to for inspiration along with the now defunct [Minimally Minimal blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20160319234827/http://www.minimallyminimal.com/blog/vancouver-mm-travel-guide-15).

## A response to [Zinzy's Imposter Syndrome](https://www.zinzy.website/2024/04/06/introducing-this-i-do-know/) Post

(In an effort to be more ~~vulnerable). I was in special ed from 2nd grade to 6th grade. In high school I took {% footnoteref "ap","Advanced Placement, people at every level like to feel like someone is beneath them." %}AP{% endfootnoteref %} classes. I listened to my classmates and teachers talk about how we AP students were better than regular students. If we didn't get certain concepts, then we were as slow as special ed kids. I had this immense fear I'd be found out. People would stop thinking I'm smart. Once they did find out I was a special ed kid, I had to admit to myself I'm not smart. I thought all the A's I recieved were pitty grades. I didn't earn them. But of course, the Cs and Ds were validating how worthless I was and I absolutely earned *those* grades.

High school has a unique way of getting you to despise yourself.

I know now how harmful that line of thinking is. Everyone goes at their own speed and besides that, academics shouldn't define anyone's self worth. However, I'll admit, I've internalized this way of thinking so much that I don't know if I'll ever be able to truly move past it.

In my work life, I don't accept compliments well because just like in high school, I think I don't truly deserve them. Negative criticisms though? Absolutely. You think I suck at my job? I agree!

## Nice KeyBoard is nice

My sister and bf got me a [Nuphy air96](https://nuphy.com/products/air96-wireless-mechanical-keyboard), my first mechanical keyboard. I love it! I didn't think I'd care so much about a keyboard. The keys having a sastisfying *clack* and such nice depth. I love how my fingers fit on the keycaps. The keyboard is also beautiful.

## Off the Web

A few days ago, I couldn't do any pushups without an immense amount of pain. I am trying to slowly work my way up to 20 push ups. Started at 1 and am now at 7. Trying to keep the old quote *"slow and steady wins the race"* top of mind. I am also running and biking again (not consistenly or well mind you).

Saw Dune 2, and listen, you *want* to attract the worm so you can ride it.

The second movie is immersive in a way the first wasn't. Don't know how to explain it, except you've got to see it. I'm now slowly reading the first book.

I want to read [The Powerbroker](https://99percentinvisible.org/club/). Considering how I read 20 pages of [G Man](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/529289/g-man-pulitzer-prize-winner-by-beverly-gage/) and haven't touched it in almost a year (my homepage is filled with lies), we'll see about that.
