## What is SQL?

SQL stands for <b>S</b>tructured <b>Q</b>uery <b>L</b>anguage. Query means the same as it does in normal English-to make a request or ask a question. So SQL is a programming language used to get information from a database.

It follows this kind of a structure:

```
DO SOMETHING from thisFile
```

| Command | Description       |  
|------------|-----------|
| SELECT * | selects all columns |
| SELECT dog | selects the column dog | 
| FROM pets | from the column cats | 
| SELECT cats, dogs | gets both the dogs and cats column |
| SELECT jumpMan AS Jumper from Fitness | renames the column jumpMan to Jumper | 
| SELECT DISTINCT year_hired FROM employees | selects unique year_hired so no repeating years appear |
| CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT column1, column2, ...FROM table_name | Saves SQL table so you can reuse it later on in the SQL file
