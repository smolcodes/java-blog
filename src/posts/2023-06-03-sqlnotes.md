## What is SQL?

SQL stands for <b>S</b>tructured <b>Q</b>uery <b>L</b>anguage. Query means the same as it does in normal English-to make a request or ask a question. So SQL is a programming language used to get information from a database.

It follows this kind of a structure:

```
DO SOMETHING from thisFile
```

| Command | Description       |  
|------------|-----------|
| SELECT * | selects all columns |
| SELECT dog | selects the column dog | 
| FROM pets | from the column cats | 
| SELECT cats, dogs | gets both the dogs and cats column |
| SELECT jumpMan AS Jumper from Fitness | renames the column jumpMan to Jumper | 
| SELECT DISTINCT year_hired FROM employees | selects unique year_hired so no repeating years appear |
| CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT column1, column2, ...FROM table_name | Saves SQL table so you can reuse it later on in the SQL file

## SQL Logic Operators

Logic Operators lets you refine what you want to extract from a table.

| Command | Description       |  
|------------|-----------|
| ALL | True if all are true |
| AND | True if A and B are true | 
| ANY | True if any statement is true | 
| BETWEEN | True if argument exists within range |
| EXISTS | True if argument exists within rows | 
| IN | True if value is equal to a value in a list|
| LIKE | True if argument matches a pattern |
| NOT | Reverses the result of boolean operator |
| OR | True if either argument is true |
| SOME | True if some of the argument is true |
