## A Response to [Anhvn](https://anhvn.com/posts/2023/i-wish-tumblr-would-invest-in-its-theme-features/) and [Faiz](https://fukuo.site/post/728085005134413824/my-pet-peeves-when-using-a-tumblr-official-theme)

I love making websites with 11ty because it's so similar to Tumblr. My opinion on Tumblr is I don't know if different is the right word but,something else because of my retail background.

I joined Tumblr when it was getting large. And like Faiz I too tried to get my themes to be premium. <a href="https://smolthemes.tumblr.com/post/620752852739080192/journal-a-premium-theme-centered-around-big">This theme</a> specifically, but unlike Faiz, I wasn't successfull.

Part of my problem was I undervalued my skills from the get go. I made all my themes free and I refused to learn marketing and tbh, wasn't very social on the Tumblr sphere. I also *massively* sucked at responding to user questions.

### Reasons why Tumblr was Good:

* You could connect your theme to Github and it would update automatically whenever you updated the github file.
* The documentation was *great*. Especially for a newbie like me who needed a lot of hand holding.
* Like [Ahnvn stated](https://anhvn.com/posts/2023/i-wish-tumblr-would-invest-in-its-theme-features/), results were immediate.

### Now

* NPF is a bit confusing. And a lot of classes have changed because of it. This makes styling themes a bit of a pain to hunt down the correct classes (restyling music blocks took forever)
* The theme preview glitches
* Boolean, drop downs and custom photo selections sometimes don't register. This is annoying because I prefer giving people choices.
* The theme garden still sucks. It features a lot of garbage (by this I mean themes that aren't even themes-they're literally slideshows with no code, or multiple plagarized themes).  

The thing is, I'm not actually sure if Tumblr is profitable. [Tech Crunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/12/tumblr-is-losing-30m-each-year-ceo-says/#:~:text=The%20fundamental%20tension%20of%20Tumblr,pay%20to%20subscribe%20to%20creators) doesn't think so. Similar to me, Tumblr didn't really charge for its service. And now it can't. The user base (me included, I am definitely part of the problem) will not pay for Tumblr premium. I mean I'm sure there are people who do, but how many? My guess is less than 10%. Sure users buy checkmarks, crabs etc (and it looks like Tumblr even has a merch store!) but how much revenue does those initiatives make? 

I'm not sure *response* is the right thing to call this. This is not an attack on eithr Faiz or Anhvn. These are just my thoughts after reading their posts.

## Scattered thoughts

I wonder if [read.cv](https://read.cv/explore) is the new Tumblr. I know it's supposed to be more lit Peerlist or Polywork but those sites are serious (and boring and remind me of my day job). Read.cv is *fun* and also stuffed with inspiration. There's parts of the internet that really want to be fun again. I'm thinking:

* [mm page](https://mmm.page/)
* [Straw Page](https://straw.page/)

## Website semi-redesign

Got imspired by [Gregory Gunderson](https://gregorygundersen.com/), [readcv](https://read.cv/em.vee) and ofcourse, [Marius Masalar](https://mariusmasalar.me/every-blogging-option-sucks?ref=magherallylens.com).

I made this design simpler because I fuss too much about the way it looks.

I want to try being more loose with this place. Write more meaningful garbage. I need to get rid of friction.

2 ways to do this is to care *less* about how it looks and also to make writing easier.

I'm going to try the online version of VSCode and see if I can make that my main driver. Not sure how that will effect the main branch though. I guess we'll see.
