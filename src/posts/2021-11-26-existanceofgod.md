<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">If we *do* blow ourselves up, does that disprove the existance of God?</p>

There's something about asking scientists (especially esteemed scientists) about God. I'm not sure where we get the idea; we think their opinions about a lot of things outside of science {% footnoteref "matter","To clarify I am very anti stay in your lane. Scientists should participate in stuff outside of science because they're multifaceted. And ya know celebrity worship does what it does." %}matter{% endfootnoteref %}. They must think this also (not all of them obviously but some of them). {% footnoteref "krauss","The man is an embarassement to science. He does not know philosophy but thinks it is cool to denigrate it nonetheless." %}Lawrence Krauss{% endfootnoteref %}. doesn't believe in God. Richard Dawkins likes to debate about God. Einstein wrote a letter about the {% footnoteref "dude","Did he want us noodles to even read the letter? I do not speak German but could not find a good translation of it. Translaters can be biased and people *really* seem to want to read him as athiest (we know he does not follow the judaic-christian God but God in a hand wawy general sense? Who knows?)" %}Dude{% endfootnoteref %}. I appreciate {% footnoteref "russel","I know, he was a philosopher and mathematician and  not scientist but hey it is my post." %}Bertrand Russel{% endfootnoteref %} for at least giving the guy a name. It is in this paragraph always about the [Jewish/Christian God](https://users.drew.edu/~jlenz/whynot.html). 

I'm not sure how I stumbled on the Sagan youtube video. Happenstance I guess but man it is refreshing to hear a scientist call this out. His response reminds me of the [Myth of Sisyshus](https://www2.hawaii.edu/~freeman/courses/phil360/16.%20Myth%20of%20Sisyphus.pdf). Science is about discovery and to some degree (as someone who used to study science) studying for ourselves.

I used to love taking lab classes. Here you find out for yourself the theories these professors are talking about. You shouldn't wholesale believe something just because a professor said it is so. People look for some smart guy who holds their beliefs and then appeal to authority. "Of course God isn't real-Krauss said so!". It is good to have multiple perspectives. These guys views are valuable but at some point, I think you should sit down with yourself and think "ok but what if all these guys I look up to completely disagree with me? Shall my opinons change? Why? Were their arguments compelling?".

I bumped into [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/index) way back in 2011 in community college and I find this site is becoming more and more like theirs (but a very bad version of it-like extremely bad). There's some posts I've made that might actually be useful ([this](/installingjavaasablindperson/), [this](/java-part-2/) and maybe even [this](/2021-1-17-installing-hyvor/)). Although I'm not sure if the information in those aformentioned links are altogether correct. But this God post here is...garbage. Maybe I should give posts that seem more polished their own unique tag? But then I'd have to dig through my posts and re-tag them (that's a lot of work).
