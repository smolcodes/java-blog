## Obsidian and PageCMS

I am ditching VSCode as a post writer and trying Obsidian and PageCMS. As explained [in my previous post](/weekupdate/) I want to be better at cataloging my links. The biggest hurdle to overcome is writing two files with the same name. I thought having unique date identifiers would clear this up but so far, that's not the case. It's possible I'm not looking in the right places.

I'm also tired of writing my posts in VSCode.  I got this idea from [Deepak](https://deepakness.com/blog/publishing-from-obsidian-using-11ty/) to use Obsidian.

The video and his blog were easy to follow. Next I used [Obsidian Rock's](https://obsidian.rocks/getting-started-with-templates-in-obsidian/) tutorial for creating my template.  Now my problem is trying to get my markdown files to by default be named YYY-MM-DD-BlogPost.md. Currently I still have to do most of this manually. I know some CMS's do this right out of the box. So there is a way. I just need to find it.
