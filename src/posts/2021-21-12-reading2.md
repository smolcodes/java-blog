I am trying to, as best as I can, to separate the useful from the unimportant. You may safely assume anything tagged "reading" is unimportant. This post is tagged "reading".

Read [This article first](https://www.simonoregan.com/short-thoughts/the-bullshit-industrial-complex) and then have a look at this [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=brian+eno+nft&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS936US936&ei=aQ_CYfzqLZGf_QawuI-4Dw&start=0&sa=N&ved=2ahUKEwi8w739tfX0AhWRT98KHTDcA_c4MhDy0wN6BAgBEDY&cshid=1640107954084751&biw=1908&bih=896&dpr=1). All of the articles on the first 10 search pages are a summary of [this article](https://the-crypto-syllabus.com/brian-eno-on-nfts-and-automatism/). I'm not sure how many pages one would have to dig through to actually even *see* [The Crypto Syllabus](https://the-crypto-syllabus.com/) or if a user who read The Verge's article would click through to the original article. My guess is very little. So I've read these summaries to see if they had anything substantial or different to add and the answer is no. So far, as near as I can tell, the summaries have been somewhat accurate. The reason for "somewhat" is that they dn't really describe why. All these pro nft sites are willing to admit, yes, there is a climate change problem with this currency system but they at best half heartedly nod at the ethical problems. *It might be there but think of the potential.*. Eno in the interview talks mainly about the ethical qualms. Simon O'Regan's post is about bullshit reproduction and this Google search shows this quite well. Sadly it seems, bullshit gets more attention.

These days if you are a developer you are told to have some kind of a blog so now everyone has blogs. And everyone is giving advice on self care and productivity. And these posts, although a dime a dozen seem to never lose their luster. As a web designer, you've probably heard of [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/) and [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/). You've probably also read posts that reference them. Posts pertaining to these two men tend to regurgitate what they've already said. You rarely get anyone questioning them.
