I watched one [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkl9_3-jX6c&ab_channel=Downshiftology) on midnight oats and now think I'm an expert. The warning is: I've never had midnight oats before. This could be gross but maybe it could be really good.

## Ingrediants

* 1 cup of oats (not the instant kind! ). If you're not an oats person you could probably sub it with quinoa (but you'll have to cook it)
* 1 cup of milk
* 1 cup of vanilla yogurt
* 1tbs cardomom syrup
* whatever you want on top. I'm putting in strawberries, blueberries and walnuts

## The Steps

1. Put in the oats, then milk, then yogurt. Next add the cardomom. Stir it all together.
2. Let sit until the morning.
3. Put on toppings.

Done. That was easy. Is it good? Who knows!
