Alright, this post is very loonnnggg. I really let myself barf up a lot of words. If brevity is the soul of wit than I probably don't have wit or soul (and that's fine).

Let me explain the asterisk. I *loved* this book. It is chef's kiss but it's also a textbook and I cannot really recommend it as leisure reading (it is much more dense than the [Dale Carnegie](https://smolnotes.netlify.app/thequickandeasywaytoeffectivespeaking/) book). Even for those who enjoy reading textbooks I'm ambivalent because it is very much so out-dated (for example, professionals in the field are now called *therapists* (this is according to NFB for financial accessibility reasons) instead of teachers). I have not read the most recent up to date version which heavily expands on the original with additions such as tips for comorbidity. 

My biggist reservation for not recommending this book is that I am not a visual rehabilitation therapist. I have never worked in this field or even a peripherally related one. I do not want to spread false information about a field I know very little about so if after reading this forever post you decide to read the book anyway...I suggest you tread lightly and realize that at the end of the day you probably don't know anything (and that's fine).

## Summary

This book is an introductory brief overview of being a visual rehabilition therapist. It was the first cohesive textbook of high caliber for the visual rehabilitation field. It covers the role of the CVRT(certified vision rehabilitation therapist) along with tips to do the job (such as task analysis). In addition, it also goes over auxilliary parts of the job (such as paperwork, generating leads and different responsibilities the CVRT may have depending on their organization). And it describes other professionals who work alongside the CVRT (examples: orientation and mobility instructors and assistive technology instructors).

I read the text to speech version of the book but the physical textbook includes many diagrams, charts, graphs and examples of the paperwork along with assignments.

I think this is read by grad students (?). The Ponchillias constantly recommend outside reading (especially psychology papers). 

## Reason for reading this book

The main reason was to test out text to speach. BVH (blind and visually handicapped) readers may consume text in a number of ways: through large print books, braille and talking audio books (audiobooks and text to speach). A standard audio book (think of ones from audible) is not as robust as DAISY books. You can do with these books what you can do with an ordinary printed book. You may save pages and passages, highlight text, make notes and even look up words. The downside of DAISY files is that they are rather large and are read to you using a text to speach program.

I don't enjoy listening to a robotic voice but believed if I could "tune" my ears to these strange sounds, I would eventually be ok with it. I chose *Foundations* because it's very long so it would allow my ears plenty of time to adjust.

You might be wondering *Why not other long books?*. Well, reader, I did attempt Moby Dick but quickly gave up as the monotone emotionless voice made it nearly impossible to enjoy the story. I settled for a regular audiobook read by a good sounding human instead (and no I've not finished the book).

Technical books such as *Foundations* aren't reliant on characters with unique voices so I found it easier and even at times better than actually reading text. However as I am a sighted person, I found certain parts of the book difficult to understand without visual aid (more on this later in the post).

## Thoughts through the Chapters (or the very long rambly part of the post)

A book is great not only because of how it is written but also when it was read. Had I read this book in highschool, I probably would have thought it was boring. 

I started reading this book during my third month working at the Bank. This was my first job where I was being confronted with my crap eyesight almost every day. Clients were pissed at me because I was slow. When I took too long to read their IDs, they would berate me. Reading this book was like therapy. The Ponchillias truly understood the plight of those with low vision (hint: it's people, not the actual dissability). They brought up many points that I've tried to ignore (those who are congenitally blind can bo too reluctant to ask for help or too dependent on others for example). Anyway, below are my thoughts organized by sections.

<summary>
    Part 1: Profession of the Rehabilitation Teaching & Chapter 1 An Introduction to the Profession
</summary>

  To be quite honest, I don't really remember this chapter that well. Listening to a professionally read audiobook is very different from text to speach. To be sure, this technology has come a long way from when I was a child (as a dumb young fool, I refused to engage with text to speach). 

  I remember the book discussed Canada a bit but also the business side of the job. It talked about time management and how you might want to devote more time to a specific struggling client, but you have other clients to assist as well. The book stated you may have multiple clients a day in different areas so you must plan accordingly.

  The Process of Rehabilitation: Chapters 4,5 and 6.
  </summary>

 This part I remember being quite laborious sounding. And very clerical. But I suppose no industry can escape paperwork's grip. I remember there was an example on writing lesson plans for things that didn't sound like they'd have a lesson plan ex: sweeping (this is a tad ironic as *I* learned from a CVRT how to sweep). There was countless examples of forms one may come accross, and kinds of information a CVRT should be aware of or leave for others (such as academic, medical, familial and recreational information).

 I found this part difficult to understand because as a sighted person, I'm used to seeing forms. Listening was difficult, especially because the monotone voice would trail from one word to the next. I should have gone back and maybe even slowed downthe text to speach.

 The theories on adult learning were really interesting to me. This is the part of the book I want to go back to. I took a ton of notes but lost them.

 What was really refreshing to hear was the authors' awareness of the perspective of both the teacher and client. They brought up certain harmful perceptions that both parties might have and stressed caution and respect on the part of the instructor.

I wonder if the Ponchillias owned an abacus. I'll be honest, I don't remeber this section too well (I was reading whilst falling asleep haha) but what I do remember is the abacus. I was shocked to learn it was being taught to the blind!

To go back to a recurring theme here, I found the abacus section quite difficult because I didn't have an abacus infront of me to work through the lessons that were being taught. But I also didn't have photos of the abacus either.

This section is also perhaps the most revealing of why I am hesitant to recommend this book. THere's a lot of tech used here that are no longer used. At some point the authors mentioned rotary phones (they were exiting popular existance by the time I was born). There was discussion of other oldfangled tech that I had never even heard of. The important takeaway though, is to make lessons relative to the learner. If you are teaching a client to navigate their home and they know B

   Activities of Daily Living Skills: Chapters 12-16
  </summary>
I found this section of the book to be the most difficult to read. To be a a CVRT requires a great deal of maturity and this section shows (excrutiatingly clearly) why. Three common instances displayed in the book struck me:

 _Appearance_: To be employable, one must be presentable. We can argue all day long about whether one aught to judge others by their appearance but this is unfortunately a fact of living in a society. The Ponchillias talked about assisting clients with fashion. They stated it is important to make sure the client is wearing what is in vogue (what shall aid them in acquiring a job and also not intrude on their self-worth). Fashion is so personal. I am not sure *how* I would even tell someone what to wear. The same with makeup.

Continuing with image, they gave an example of a client who's eye was rotting. The client asked their CVRT if they should consider replacing the eye with a prosthetic. The CVRT suggested this kind of surgery might be worth looking into so the client could make a better first impression amongst the sighted. 

There must be a great deal of trust between both the client and CVRT in both these cases. >Perhaps I am struggling to see outside myself but I would be hesitant to ask a CVRT to assist me with fashion and prosthetic eyes.

_Insulin_: Some forms of vision loss is caused by diabetes (diabetic retinopathy). This can be from unmaintained diabetes where blood sugars are not always carefully watched. This eye condition is rare and the progression of eye loss can be abated but not cured. Clients with diabetes might need to know how to monitor their glucose levels and inject insulin. They would also need to know how to take other necessary medications. And when teaching them, it is important to have sugar on hand. All of this sounds like quite a lot of responsiblity to me. Reading this part gave me fear. *What if I gave them the wrong amount of insulin?* This is an odd fear to have since I don't plan to a CVRT but also because the CVRT would work closely with a physician. They might not even administer medcation to the client and instead guide the physician in aiding the client.  

I loved the section about cooking and orienting. The general idea seemed to be use what the client enjoys to help them become independent. Essentially have them direct their learning. Clients might be more excited to learn if they are allowed to take initiative. The point of the job after all is to help the client live the life the client wishes to live-not what the CVRT *thinks* they should live. The book discussed picking out cooking food the client liked or doing a hobby with them that they enjoyed.

## Conclusion

I'm going to reread this book (still uisng text to speach). And maybe a bit slower. This summary has told me I did not read the book thoroughly enough since I don't remember most of it. I will leave this review up for posterity though. And the follow up review might be in a year. Who knows? I'm not in a rush.

There is a part of the book though that I'd like to know other CVRT's thoughts on. The Ponchillias make it abundently clear that it is important to make sure the clients have self-worth, that the clients value their existance and that they appreciate who they are and could be; essentially, it is the job of the CVRT to help clients have good self esteem. In this respect their role is not mearely *teacher* but also therapist.

The Ponchillias mentioned throughout the book that is important the basic needs of the clients are first taken care of. Do they have:

* access to food?
* safe living quarters?
* finances to cover basic needs?
* essential health (such as medication)?

These are not problems I initially thought would be of concern for the CVRT but after reading this book, it makes a lot of sense.
