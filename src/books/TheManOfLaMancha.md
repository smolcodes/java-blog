To run where the brave dare not go,
Though the goal be forever too far.
To try, though you're wayworn and weary,
To reach the unreachable star.
To reach the unreachable star,
Though you know it's impossibly high,
To live with your heart striving upward
To a far, unattainable sky!

 Does the ending of the musical indicate the powerlessness of art? Or its strength? In both the nested story and the outer story, the protagonists meet their fate and those they've affected are changed. These changed people-now hopeful-can't actually escape their own position with their newfound hope though. They can pretend to live in a world filled with chivalry but they're still poor and their jobs still suck.

 It's been so long since I bumped into a musical that rivaled Les Miserables. This has all the makings of musicals I love. There's a ton of characters and two stories, a lot of singing and a larger than life story. There's some real bangers (I Really Like Him, A Little Gossip, Barber's Song) and nice sounding songs (Little Bird, Little Bird, Dulcinea, The Impossible Dream). All of the characters are compelling. And if you're into philosophy, this musical has a lot to offer. 

I've been listening to the Spanish version of this also. Youtube has a really good version.
