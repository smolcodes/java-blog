I've been a long time reader of [John Scalzi's blog](https://whatever.scalzi.com/). Well, it was about time to actually read his books. 

So *Head On* is the kind of book that's perfect for riding on the bus or a lunch break at a busy place. It's a nice, fun fair. It's your standard cops get the bad guys but this time in the future, with a sport where players rip each others' heads off. I can't say it goes beyond that.
