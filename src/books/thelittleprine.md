The book was not at all what I was expecting. It reads more as an adult book told in a childish manor rather than a children's book about adult topics. The book isn't about the prince, it's about the narrator finding a way, through a journey with the Prince, to maintain their youth.

The Prince goes from planet to planet meeting adults who deal with "matters of consequence". Or adults winding around the motion of life but clearly not enjoying it. The Prince eventual descends on Earth to meet the narrator. He sees the narrator can be saved. And so does save him. 

The book was cute and short. The themes it touches on (lonileness, adults' nature of hampering creativity, a lack of appreciation for life, valuing the unimportant) are ones that plague my mind. Mostly at night when I want to go to sleeep.
